# Cocoa and Code

Saturday morning intros to coding.

A few ideas to try to explain the world of code to girls that have not been exposed to coding.
Let's see how this goes.

After thinking about it a little bit, I think there are three things that sonmeone needs to learn and understand for blissful coding ever after

## Tools of the trade
There is a small arsenal of tools that is required to be able to code, it is important to understand those.

## Know how to code
Being able to express your thoughts in the various languages that the computer unterstands is of course at the core of coding

## Attitude and Etiquette
Coding is more of a team sport than a solo thing, so being open, nice and helpful is possibly the most important lesson about coding.
