# Tools of the Trade

To get started with coding, you need three things, 

1. a browser (Chrome)
2. an internet connection and Google
3. a text editor

as for the text editor i am using http://brackets.io/

# Your first HTML document

HTML is the first of three main languages that your browser understands.
Create an HTML document with the extension .html and paste:

~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
~~~~

open in browser by double clicking, and see via "view source".
