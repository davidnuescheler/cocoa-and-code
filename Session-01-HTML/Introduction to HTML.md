# Tools of the Trade

To get started with coding, you need three things, 

1. a browser (Chrome)
2. an internet connection and Google
3. a text editor

as for the text editor i am using http://brackets.io/

# Your first HTML document

HTML is the first of three main languages that your browser understands.
Create an HTML document with the extension .html and paste:

~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
~~~~

open in browser by double clicking, and see via "view source".

## Tags

The stuff inside brackets are called tags and they really are the instructions to browser. just think of `<!DOCTYPE html>` as something that tells that computer what language this file is in, and as `<html>` as your beginning of your documents.

Most HTML tags have closing tags that start with a `/`, which indicate the end of a section. So `<html>` pairs up with the corresponding `<\html>` at the very end of the document, or `<h1>` and `</h1>`. 

Brackets (your text editor) will help you with this a little bit, and whenever you write an opening tag, it will automatically provide a closing tag.

To make things simple, always lowercase your tags.

## White space and formatting

HTML ignores all white space (more than one space, linefeed, tabs, etc.) are all just considered one space. This means that you can layout your code in your text editor however you want without impacting the result.

Try to add some blank lines into you document possibly between the words `first` and `paragraph`, save, reload your browser window (or reopen your document) and you will see that this has no impact.
